The COVID-19 epidemic has left many families in our community in a state of fear and uncertainty. From social distancing to school closures, parents are now having to face these new realities head on.

Local school districts, including the Vancouver School District, have released a statement describing their plan to continue education through this crisis:

> [...] VPS is developing a plan for online/remote learning that we intend to roll out after spring break. Instructional activities may be delivered to homes through digital technology tools, paper copies of learning packets or a combination of both. Your student’s principal will be sending a letter later this week with more details.

Our schools are making an effort, but many parents may still feel overwhelmed by trying to ensure that their kids have everything they need to succeed in their education.

As a former owner of the Clark County Sylvan Learning Centers, I have worked with many parents, grandparents, guardians, foster parents, and others throughout our community. Through these experiences, I've learned two key takeaways.

## Assume Responsibility

First of all, take responsibility for your child’s education. Take the lead in your next steps. Make adjustments now as schools attempt to respond. The school system is a very big ship that can't turn very quickly, and even in the best-case scenario it isn't capable of perfectly targeting your child’s ongoing needs.

Your child’s education is your responsibility and school is a tool given to help you educate your children. Sometimes this tool is able to do much of the work and provide the general framework to meet your child’s educational goals. But at best it is second place in your child’s education: the biggest piece of the puzzle is you!

Parents are by far the most important factor in the success or failure of their kids' education. I have been fortunate in my professional career to work with hundreds of parents who understand this and take on the responsibility of coaching, mentoring, and leading their kids through a successful and nurturing learning experience. In the educational wilderness, there is a promised land where your child can become a happy, confident, skilled, and balanced young adult that is prepared to launch into this exciting—and challenging—world we live in.

## Keep It Simple, Soldier

As a former homeschool parent, I find that if you lay out a plan that operates on the K.I.S.S principle (Keep It Simple, Soldier), it will help everyone work together with the least amount of friction and the best possible results. We only needed a couple of hours a day for the basic subjects. Find a few websites and set up a schedule for the kids to work on.

For example, when teaching math, I like to use IXL and Khan Academy. They are designed with simple programs that can easily be implemented and will keep improving your student’s skills. Stick to around 2 hours on a limited number of websites, then give your kids some well-earned freedom of choice. They will love you for it.

Parents need a lot of support in this most challenging task. Success usually requires a team, so many other parents, coaches, teachers, and child-oriented businesses are often enlisted to help. The future is uncertain—maybe school won’t resume this year, and a big part of your regular educational plan will be missing. That’s a big challenge, but it’s also an opportunity to grow closer to your family. A new and exciting adventure!

In order to help ease this transition, you might consider hiring a tutor. I have been tutoring for over 40 years and have experience working with hundreds of students. There are many different reasons why you might use tutoring services for your students, but here are just a few:

- **Skill building**. Tutors can help identify and address deficits that your child may have in their education relative to their grade level.
- **Structure**. Tutors are experts at providing and maintaining a framework for your student's curriculum.
- **Excellence**. Tutors may be able to keep your children ahead of their coursework and prepare them for the next school year.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, all of my tutoring services will be provided online via Google Hangouts. Through video meetings, I will get to know you and your student. Together, we can assess your child's needs and come up with a plan that works for your family.
