As a former owner of Clark County Sylvan Learning Centers, I have worked with many parents, grandparents, foster parents, and others throughout our community. I have some thoughts and conclusions that might be helpful at this time during COVID-19.

Your child’s education is your responsibility and a school is a tool given to help you educate your children. Sometimes this tool is able to do much of the work and provide the general framework to meet your child’s educational goals, but at best it is second place in the importance of your child’s overall education, number one is you. Parents are by far the most important determinant in the success or failure of their kids. I have been fortunate in my professional career, to work with hundreds of parents who understand this and take on the responsibility to coach, mentor, and lead their kids towards a successful and nurturing education. In the educational wilderness, there is a promised land where your child can be happy, confident, skilled, and a balanced young adult that is prepared to launch into this exciting, challenging, world we live in.

Parents need a lot of support in this most challenging task. Success usually requires a team and so many other parents, coaches, teachers, child-oriented businesses are often enlisted to help. We parents need a lot of assistance.

So what are we to do during this most extraordinarily challenging time?

Number one, assume responsibility for your child’s education and take lead in what to do next. Make adjustments now as schools attempt to respond. They are a very big ship that doesn’t turn very quickly and, in the best-case scenario, are not capable of targeting your child’s ongoing needs. I am currently a tutor and a substitute teacher in the Vancouver and Evergreen School Systems here in Vancouver, WA.

Here is some important information from the Vancouver School District:

> **Important dates:**  March 27th, 2020 - School Principals communicate to parents their school’s learning plan

> VPS is developing a plan for online remote learning that we intend to roll out after spring break. Each school’s principal will send out a letter later this week with more details.

> Teachers may send optional learning resources and activities to parents and students. They may refer to the optional learning resources and activities posted on the district’s website, or they may suggest other ways that parents keep their children engaged in learning during the closure. In their communications, teachers must state clearly, that those learning resources and activities are optional and will not be graded into a student’s class grades. OSPI (Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction) says educational services for all students will begin Monday, March 30th and payroll continues for all employees.

In summary, they may not have more than optional activities for the kids. Activities that will not be included in their grade. That means you will have to sell your kids on moving their educations forward voluntarily. Good luck with that. As a former homeschool parent, I find that if you lay out a plan that operates on the K.I.S.S principle (Keep It Simple Soldier), it will help all of you work together with the least amount of friction and the best results. We only needed a couple of hours a day for the basic subjects. Find a few websites and set up a schedule for the kids to work on. A schedule that you will monitor the progress of daily and weekly.

For example: with math I like to use IXL and Khan Academy. They are organized with simple programs that can easily be implemented and keep improving your student’s skills if you place them in the right levels of the programs. Stick to around 2 hours working with these websites, then give your kids some well-earned freedom of choice. They will love you for it.

Maybe school won’t resume this year. That’s a big challenge, but it’s also an opportunity to grow closer to your family. A new and exciting adventure!

In order to help ease this transition, you might consider hiring a tutor. I have been tutoring for over 40 years and have experience working with hundreds of students. There are many different reasons why you might use tutoring services for your students. Here are just a few:

- Skill building. Tutors can help identify and fill in holes that your child may have in their education relative to their grade.
- Maintain and provide a structure to your student's curriculum.
- Keep your children ahead of their coursework and prepare them for the next school year.

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, all of my tutoring services will be provided online through Google Hangouts. Through video meetings, I will get to know you and your student. Together, we can assess your student's needs and come up with a plan that works for your family.
